## Motivation

<br>

`syscall-rs` is a support crate for Linux system programming. As such, this crate provides Rust friendly bindings for various
Linux programming interfaces. The idea for `syscall-rs` is to be as lightweight as possible and having a limited number of
dependencies only.

This crate is Linux **only**. That is basically the whole point of it.
